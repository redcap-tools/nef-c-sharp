# nef-c-sharp
Several people have been asking [Chris Nefcy](http://www.rad.washington.edu/radiology-personnel/cnefcy) ([University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) Medicine, [Dept of Radiology](http://www.rad.washington.edu/)) for his  C# code that calls [REDCap](http://project-redcap.org/)'s API and DET.  We decided that this new [REDCap-Tools](https://github.com/redcap-tools) GitHub organization would be a good place to distribute it.

Currently, this repository has two examples.  Click below to view their contents and README file.
* [API Example](/ApiExample)
* [DET Sample](/DetSample)

The code is distributed with an [MIT license](./LICENSE).  If you have questions, consider creating a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/redcap-tools/nef-c-sharp/issues) in this repository.

### REDCap-Tools Repository
This repository is housed in the [REDCap-Tools](https://github.com/redcap-tools) organization.  This organization fosters interesting projects built against [REDCap](http://project-redcap.org). Developers and projects in this organization have no official ties to REDCap other than looking to push the data management capabilities provided by REDCap's more advanced tools (namely the API and Data Entry Triggers) to their fullest potential. We hope to foster projects across a wide-range of programming languages.  Our other goal is to connect users to the best existing [libraries and resources](/projects) for their needs.  For more information, please visit the [organization website](http://redcap-tools.github.io/).
