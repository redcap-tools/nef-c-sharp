# nef-c-sharp
Several people have been asking [Chris Nefcy](http://www.rad.washington.edu/radiology-personnel/cnefcy) for his  C# code that calls REDCap's API and DET.  We decided that this new [redcap-tools](https://github.com/redcap-tools) GitHub organization would be a good place to distribute it.

Currently, this repository has two examples.  Click below to view their contents and README file.
* [API Example](/ApiExample)
* [DET Sample](/DetSample)

The code is distributed with an [MIT license](./LICENSE).  If you have questions, consider creating a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/redcap-tools/nef-c-sharp/issues) in this repository.
