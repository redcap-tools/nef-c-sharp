Several people have been asking [Chris Nefcy](http://www.rad.washington.edu/radiology-personnel/cnefcy) for his  C# code that calls REDCap's API.  We decided that this new org would be agood place to distribute it.

In Chris's words (*I'll paraphrase later*):
> So, for pushing DataTables to/from RC, I put together a couple of functions that folks can use in their code.  They need the CSVDoc.cs code, but the SampleCode.cs is just that.  It can be used in an .aspx program, or in a windows desktop program, a DET program, etc.  It would just be a cut and paste type thing.  I know, a little rough, but I didn’t have the time to make them into classes or something more elegant.  I just usually cut and paste between my many programs.

> I actually put that code into a class, but I thought that would be confusing.  Programmers tend to have their own way of doing things, so I just sent the few routines that would normally be in the class.

> The code uses csv flat for all of the imports/exports from RC.  I find it much more compact than json or xml in returning data.  I put a bunch of comments in the code trying to point things out.  See what you think.  Hey, it’s a start.
